--- abstract

This document specifies algorithm profiles for SUIT manifest parsers and authors to ensure better interoperability. These profiles apply specifically to a constrained node software update use case.

#  Introduction

Mandatory algorithms may change over time due to an evolving threat landscape. Algorithms are grouped into algorithm profiles to account for this. Profiles may be deprecated over time. SUIT will define four choices of MTI profile specifically for constrained node software update. These profiles are:

* One Symmetric MTI profile
* Two "Current" Asymmetric MTI profiles
* One "Future" Asymmetric MTI profile

At least one MTI algorithm in each category MUST be FIPS qualified.

Because SUIT presents an asymmetric communication profile, with powerful/complex manifest authors and constrined manifest recipients, the requirements for Recipients and Authors are different.

Recipients MAY choose which MTI profile they wish to implement. It is RECOMMENDED thaty they implement the "Future" Asymmetric MTI profile. Recipients MAY implement any number of other profiles.

Authors MUST implement all MTI profiles. Authors MAY implement any number of other profiles.

Other use-cases of SUIT MAY define their own MTI algorithms.

# Algorithms

The algorithms that form a part of the profiles defined in this document are grouped into:

* Digest Algorithms
* Authentication Algorithms
* Key Exchange Algorithms
* Encryption Algorithms

## Digest Algorithms

* SHA-256 (-16)

## Authentication Algorithms

Authentication Algorithms are divided into three categories:

### Symmetric Authentication Algorithm

* HMAC-256 (5)

### Asymmetric Classical Authentication Algorithms

* ES256 (-7)
* EdDSA (-8)

### Asymmetric Post-Quantum Authentication Algorithms

* HSS-LMS (-46) {{RFC8778}}

## Key Exchange Algorithms

Key Exchange Algorithms are divided into two three groups: Symmetric, Classical Asymmetric, and Post-Quantum Asymmetric

### Symmetric

* A128 (-3)

### Classical Asymmetric

* COSE HPKE (TBD)
* ECDH-ES + HKDF-256 (-25)

## Encryption Algorithms

* A128GCM (1)

# Profiles
