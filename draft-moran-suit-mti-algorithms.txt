1.  Introduction

   Mandatory algorithms may change over time due to an evolving threat
   landscape.  Algorithms are grouped into algorithm profiles to account
   for this.  Profiles may be deprecated over time.  SUIT will define
   four choices of MTI profile specifically for constrained node
   software update.  These profiles are:

   *  One Symmetric MTI profile

   *  Two "Current" Asymmetric MTI profiles

   *  One "Future" Asymmetric MTI profile

   At least one MTI algorithm in each category MUST be FIPS qualified.

   Because SUIT presents an asymmetric communication profile, with
   powerful/complex manifest authors and constrined manifest recipients,
   the requirements for Recipients and Authors are different.

   Recipients MAY choose which MTI profile they wish to implement.  It
   is RECOMMENDED thaty they implement the "Future" Asymmetric MTI
   profile.  Recipients MAY implement any number of other profiles.

   Authors MUST implement all MTI profiles.  Authors MAY implement any
   number of other profiles.

   Other use-cases of SUIT MAY define their own MTI algorithms.

2.  Algorithms

   The algorithms that form a part of the profiles defined in this
   document are grouped into:

   *  Digest Algorithms

   *  Authentication Algorithms

   *  Key Exchange Algorithms

   *  Encryption Algorithms

2.1.  Digest Algorithms

   *  SHA-256 (-16)

2.2.  Authentication Algorithms

   Authentication Algorithms are divided into three categories:

2.2.1.  Symmetric Authentication Algorithm

   *  HMAC-256 (5)

2.2.2.  Asymmetric Classical Authentication Algorithms

   *  ES256 (-7)

   *  EdDSA (-8)

2.2.3.  Asymmetric Post-Quantum Authentication Algorithms

   *  HSS-LMS (-46) [RFC8778]

2.3.  Key Exchange Algorithms

   Key Exchange Algorithms are divided into two three groups: Symmetric,
   Classical Asymmetric, and Post-Quantum Asymmetric
